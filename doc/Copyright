The name MudOS is copyright 1991-1992 by Erik Kay, Adam Beeman, Stephan Iannce
and John Garnett.  LPmud copyright restrictions still apply.

In addition, the entire package is copyright 1995 by Tim Hollebeek.

******

The name Neolith is copyright (C) 2000-2001 by Min-Hsin Chang. LPmud and MudOS
copyright restrictions still apply because Neolith is actually based on a
heavily modified version of MudOS v22pre5.

The part added/modified (compared against MudOS v22pre5) in Neolith is in fact
distributed under GPL. Should there be conflict between LPmud, MudOS copyright
restrictions and GPL, the former takes precedence. (For example: commercial
use of source code is forbidden because Lars wouldn't like it).

As long as you can obtain permissions from the other authors of LPmud and
MudOS (dozens of them, check out the Credits.LPmud and Credits.MudOS), you 
need only follow GPL to use this package.

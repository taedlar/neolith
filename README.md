## License
Neolith is a LPMud Driver that run the Eastern Stories 2 MUD since 1995. The code was modified from MudOS v22pre5, which is a derived work of the original LPMud by Lars Penj|. I intended to distribute my parts of code in GPL style, and the copyright notices from original authors of MudOS and LPMud should also apply to this derived work (see [Copyright](doc/Copyright) for details). In brief:  
- **"May not be used in any way whatsoever for monetary gain"** (restriction by Lars Penj|)
- **GPLv2** (open source is required, must comply all restrictions from all authors)

## Install
Neolith is mainly written in C Language. For building the program, see [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).

# valid_asm
## NAME
          valid_asm - controls whether or not a LPC->C compiled object
          can use asm { }

## SYNOPSIS
          int valid_asm( string file );

## DESCRIPTION
          When the driver is compiled with LPC_TO_C, valid_asm() is
          called whenever the asm { } structure is found in code.  If
          it returns 0, the compilation will terminate with an error.

          The asm { } structure is used as follows:

               asm {
                 <C code>
               }

          It causes the code between the braces to be literally
          inserted into the compiled file.

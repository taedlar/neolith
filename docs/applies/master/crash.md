## DESCRIPTION
The driver calls `crash()` in master in the event that the driver crashes (segmentation fault, bus error, etc).
This function offers a way to shutdown the mudlib (safe players and other important data) before the driver crashes.
It also lets you log various useful information such as what signal crashed the driver, what object was active, who the current player was etc.

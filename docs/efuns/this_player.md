# this_player()
## SYNOPSIS
~~~cxx
object this_player( int flag );
~~~

## DESCRIPTION
Return the object representing the player that caused the
calling function to be called.  Note that this_player() may
return a different value than this_object() even when called
from within a player object.  If this_player is called as
this_player(1) then the returned value will be the
interactive that caused the calling function to be called.
this_player(1) may return a different value than
this_player() in certain cases (such as when command() is
used by an admin to force a player to perform some command).

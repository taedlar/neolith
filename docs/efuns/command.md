# command()
## NAME
**command** - execute a command as if given by the object

## SYNOPSIS
~~~cxx
int command( string str, object ob );
~~~

## DESCRIPTION
Execute `str' for object `ob', or this_object() if `ob' is
omitted.  Note that the usability of the second argument is
determined by the local administrator and will usually not
be available, in which case an error will result.  In case
of failure, 0 is returned, otherwise a numeric value is
returned, which is the LPC "evaluation cost" of the command.
Bigger numbers mean higher cost, but the whole scale is
subjective and unreliable.

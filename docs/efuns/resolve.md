# resolve()
## NAME
**resolve** - resolve an internet address to domain name, or vice versa.

## SYNOPSIS
~~~cxx
int resolve( string address, string callback_func );
~~~

## DESCRIPTION
resolve() resolves `address', which should be an internet address in the form "127.0.0.1" or a domain name, into its domain name, or internet address.
When the resolve is complete, `callback_func' will be called in the current object.
The form of the callback is:

void callback(string address, string resolved, int key);

`key` will match up with the number that the call to resolve() returned.
`address` will be the domain name of the host, and `resolved' the dotted decimal ip address.
The unknown value will be 0 if the lookup failed.

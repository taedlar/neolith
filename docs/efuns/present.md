# present
## NAME
          present() - find an object by id

## SYNOPSIS
          object present( mixed str, object ob );

## DESCRIPTION
          If an object that identifies to the name `str' is present,
          then return it.

          `str' can also be an object, in which case the test is much
          faster and easier.

          If `ob' is given, then the search is done in the inventory
          of `ob', otherwise the object is searched for in the
          inventory of the current object, and in the inventory of the
          environment of the current object.

# Setting Up Build Environment

The recommended development environment is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.

> [!TIP]
> For Windows users, the build is also tested with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows 10.  
> See [Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for instructions to install Ubuntu on Windows.

You also need the following packages:
~~~sh
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install ninja-build
sudo apt install bison
~~~

# Building with CMake

Building Neolith with CMake is made simple via presets:
~~~sh
cmake --preset linux
cmake --build --preset ci-linux
~~~
The `neolith` executable can be found in `out/build/linux/src/RelWithDebInfo/`.

## Build Presets
The following build presets are defined for regular development tasks:

Preset|Configuration|Targets|Description
---|---|---|---
`dev-linux`|Debug|`all`|Performs typical `make`.<br/>Used for feature **development** and troubleshooting.
`pr-linux`|RelWithDebInfo|`all`|Performs typical `make`.<br/>Used for unit-testing on **pull-requests** before merge into the main trunk.
`ci-linux`|RelWithDebInfo|`all`<br/>Benchmarks|Performs `make clean` and then `make`.<br/>This is the **continous-integration** build that ensures clean re-build of all targets and dependencies.<br/>Usually used after a clean re-configuration to create so-called nightly build.

## Windows Platform
Besides using WSL, it is desirable to support MSVC on Windows platform in the future.
The original MudOS and LPMud source code needs quite some portability efforts to build with Visual C++.
